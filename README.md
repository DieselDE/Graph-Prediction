# Graph-Prediction
This project is to combine my knowledge of python and machine learning into one

--- Work in progress ---

# Concept
It's supposed to be used as a possible graph prediction algorithm.
Through a machine learning process the algorithm is being adjusted for the right graphs.
After that, the algorithm should predict the next outcome with a higher than 50% precision.
